# GitHub Workflow

Banyan Labs uses GitHub Issues as the product backlog and Git worktrees for
parallel pull request work. This mirrors Base so humans and AI-assisted
development agents follow the same rules across both repositories.

## Labels

Use one primary category label on each issue:

- `bug`
  Unexpected behavior, correctness issues, regressions, and defects.
- `enhancement`
  New capabilities, product improvements, refactors, and most maintenance work.
- `documentation`
  Documentation-only changes.
- `ci`
  GitHub Actions, test automation, release automation, and CI reliability.
- `security`
  Security hardening, dependency pinning, static analysis, and permission
  tightening.

Avoid creating new `type:*` labels.

## Issue Assignment

Issues created by Codex or other automation for Banyan Labs should be assigned
to `codeforester`.

If assignment fails, the automation should mention that in its summary instead
of silently leaving the issue unassigned.

## Preferred GitHub Interface

Use `basectl gh` as the preferred interface for Banyan Labs GitHub workflows
when it supports the operation.

Prefer commands such as:

```bash
basectl gh issue create
basectl gh issue start
basectl gh pr create
basectl gh pr checks
basectl gh branch prune
```

When `basectl` is not on `PATH`, use the sibling Base checkout directly:

```bash
~/work/base/bin/basectl gh issue list
```

Fallbacks are allowed when `basectl gh` does not support the needed operation,
when local GitHub CLI authentication is unavailable, or when a structured
GitHub API is safer for the task. In those cases, use the GitHub connector,
raw `gh`, or `git` as appropriate and keep issue labels, branch names,
assignments, and PR bodies aligned with this policy.

## Branch Names

Branch names should be derived from the issue category:

```text
<category>/<issue>-<YYYYMMDD>-<slug>
```

Examples:

```text
bug/12-20260529-fix-short-code-collision
enhancement/13-20260529-add-url-shortener-api
documentation/14-20260529-document-local-setup
ci/15-20260529-add-go-tests
security/16-20260529-harden-jwt-signing
```

Use `enhancement/` for maintenance work unless the issue is more specifically
`documentation`, `ci`, or `security`.

## Worktrees

All pull request implementation work should happen in a dedicated worktree.

The main checkout can stay as the user's active working copy:

```text
~/work/banyanlabs
```

Issue work should use:

```text
~/work/banyanlabs-worktrees/<slug>
```

Create a worktree from current `origin/main`:

```bash
git fetch origin main
git worktree add -b documentation/14-20260529-document-local-setup \
  ~/work/banyanlabs-worktrees/documentation-14-local-setup origin/main
```

After a pull request is merged:

```bash
git -C ~/work/banyanlabs pull --ff-only origin main
git -C ~/work/banyanlabs worktree remove ~/work/banyanlabs-worktrees/<slug>
git -C ~/work/banyanlabs branch -d <branch>
git -C ~/work/banyanlabs push origin --delete <branch>
```

Delete remote branches after merge unless there is a specific reason to keep
one around.

## Pull Requests

Keep each PR scoped to one issue.

PR bodies should include:

- a short summary of the change
- the validation commands that were run
- `Fixes #<issue>` or `Closes #<issue>` when the merge should close the issue

Prefer small PR trains over large mixed PRs. A train may contain several
worktrees and PRs, but each PR should still close one issue cleanly.

## Milestones

Milestones represent release intent, not workflow state.

Suggested Banyan Labs milestones:

- `v0.1.0 - Workflow foundation`
  Repository workflow, CI baseline, issue labels, and contributor guidance.
- `v0.2.0 - URL shortener skeleton`
  Initial Go module, local service entrypoint, tests, and SQLite foundation.
- `v0.3.0 - Authenticated URL management`
  Signup, login, JWT handling, CRUD endpoints, and user URL listing.
- `v0.4.0 - Local product polish`
  Simple frontend, local setup automation, fixtures, and documentation.
- `v1.0.0 - Usable local release`
  Stable local developer experience and complete URL shortener workflow.

Every issue does not need a milestone. Use milestones when the issue contributes
to a concrete release goal.

## Projects

Use one GitHub Project first: `Banyan Labs Roadmap`.

Recommended fields:

- `Status`: Triage, Backlog, Ready, In Progress, In Review, Done
- `Priority`: P0, P1, P2, P3
- `Area`: App, API, Auth, Storage, Frontend, Docs, CI, Infrastructure,
  Security, Product
- `Size`: S, M, L
- `PR Train`: optional text field for batch work

Useful views:

- Board by status
- Priority view
- Release view grouped by milestone
- Bugs and CI
- Ready for PR train

Projects show workflow and prioritization. Milestones show release grouping.
